About project:
        Our project will be a program that helps university students find roommates, based on their likes and dislikes, and include some convenient tools for students on campus.  It will be able to be used at various universities for on-campus housing (for our project we will only have one universitie enabled).  Students will be able to create and save their own profile.  They will then be able to browse other potential roommates based on their profiles.  The student profiles will have various fields, for example: sleep early/late, wake up early/late, studious, quiet/lively, etc. The rooms will have various fields, like location (upper/lower floor of the building), bright/dark, etc. The goal is for a student to either choose roommates based on compatiblity to other students.
        
Course concepts:
        We will use all concepts covered in this course so far. Namely, we will use simple lists (likely arraylists) to store the properties of students and buildings whose access of data is less dynamic in nature. We will use a queue for a generated list of potential roommates. We will use a Huffman tree in a unique way as part of a method for password encryption (and potentially standard data compression). To add another layer of uniqueness, we will provide a user Interface, and if time allows, we will add more features to the student app. If there is time, we will also use our foreign language skills to add translations.
